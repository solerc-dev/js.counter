<h1 align="center"> Mario's coins counter - JavaScript Basics Project s2i </h1>

The project is a simple counter coded with **_JavaScript, HTML and CSS._** 
I decided to give it an aesthetic inspired by the Mario Bros video game, and its functionality is based on adding or subtracting coins.

In each of the actions (increment, decrement, and reset), it emits a characteristic sound from the video game.

It can be incremented and decremented, but never reduced below zero, and with the RESET button, the counter is reset to zero again. 

## Let's try it! https://marioscoinscounter.netlify.app/
