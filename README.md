## About The Project

The project is a simple counter implemented with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

I opted to give it an aesthetic inspired by the Mario Bros video game, and its functionality revolves around adding or subtracting coins.

With each action (increment, decrement, and reset), it emits a characteristic sound from the video game.
It can be incremented and decremented but never reduced below zero. The RESET button returns the counter to zero.
